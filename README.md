# CONTENT => AI

- AI is simulation of human intelligence in machines. (Can learn, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception etc.).

### Need

### Types
1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) – Specialized in one task (e.g., Google Search, Siri).
2. Genrative AI (chatGPT, deepSeek)
3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) – Human-like intelligence (not yet achieved).
4. ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) – Beyond human intelligence (theoretical).

### AI vs ML vs Deep learning
- AI: Machines mimicking human intelligence.(chess playing AI)
- ML: Subset of AI where machines learn from data.(spam detection in emails)
- Deep Learning: Subset of ML using neural networks.(self-driving cars)


## Machine learning

### 1. Supervised learning (Takes input and gives output based on training) [i/n, o/u]
- spam filtering  [i/n => email, o/u => spam?(0/1)]
- speech recognition [i/n => audio, o/u => text transcripts]
- machine translation [i/n => one language, o/u => some other language]
- online advertising [i/n => ad & user info, o/u => click?(0/1)]
- self driving car [i/n => image, radar info, o/u => position of other cars and stuff]
- visual inspection [i/n => image of product, o/u => defect?(0/1)]
- chatbot [i/n => sequence of words, o/u => the next word]

**NOTE :** Supervised learning lies at heart of Genrative AI.
