- AI is simulation of human intelligence in machines. (Can learn, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception etc.).

### Need

### Types
1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) – Specialized in one task (e.g., Google Search, Siri).
2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) – Human-like intelligence (not yet achieved).
3. ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) – Beyond human intelligence (theoretical).

### AI vs ML vs Deep learning
- AI: Machines mimicking human intelligence.(chess playing AI)
- ML: Subset of AI where machines learn from data.(spam detection in emails)
- Deep Learning: Subset of ML using neural networks.(self-driving cars)
